# Markdown-Publisher

This PHP script searches a source subdirectory containing raw Markdown files and renders a match as a printable webpage. 

## How to install

- Download or clone Markdown Publisher to your web server.
- Replace the 'Quellen' directory with a directory or a directory tree holding your markdown files and images.
- Point your browser to your web server.

## Why ist this not open source?

Markdown Publisher's css uses Tiempos as the default font and you would need to buy a license first to use it.

If you decide to use Markdown Publisher anyhow, Moritz Zimmer does not account for any issues or claims you might get with publishing you documents in Tiempos online.

## Copyleft

Feel free to change any part of Markdown Publisher, especially replacing the font specified in its css so you don't get any issues. 

If you decide to use Markdown Publisher, it would be kind of nice to mention Moritz Zimmer – at least in Markdown Publisher's source code or any work derived from it.
